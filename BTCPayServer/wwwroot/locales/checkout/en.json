  "pmnt_intro_title": "About payment",
  "pmnt_intro_content": "To ensure both your and our security and anonymity, we only accept payment with cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is a secure and anonymous payment method that is completely safe to use. The obvious disadvantage is that it is a bit more complicated to use than traditional payment methods.",
  "pmnt_intro_content_two": "We have therefore created a simple guide for you who are beginners, and who have not bought or sent cryptocurrency before. Follow the instructions carefully, and you will see that it is much easier than you think to pay with cryptocurrency.",
  "pmnt_intro_content_three": "To get started, use the navigation below. If this is your very first time with cryptocurrency, we recommend that you read our introduction to cryptocurrency before going to the guide.",
  "pmnt_crypto_title": "Introduction to Cryptocurrency",
  "pmnt_crypto_content": "Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that allows you to transfer money directly between people, without banks or authorities being involved. This freedom and security comes from the use of blockchain technology, which makes transactions reliable and secure by storing them in a decentralized and public overview. Cryptocurrency is therefore both secure and anonymous, since no central actors have control over the transactions.",
  "pmnt_crypto_content_two": "We use Bitcoin, the most well-known type of cryptocurrency, as a means of payment. The Bitcoin blockchain is open and transparent, which means that everyone can see transactions, but without the sender or recipient being able to be identified. Each transaction is linked to unique addresses without personal information. When you place an order, a unique bitcoin address is generated that is only connected to that order, and that is how we know who has completed the payment.",
  "pmnt_crypto_content_three": "Instead of traditional account and KID numbers, you will use a bitcoin address and an amount in cryptocurrency. This process gives you more privacy since you do not need to provide name, address or other personal information to us, except for a valid email address that we send your order to. You have full control over the payment, and the only thing required is the crypto amount and the recipient's address. This differs from traditional bank transfers, where personal information is stored.",
  "pmnt_crypto_content_four": "When you exchange regular currency to cryptocurrency for the first time, exchange services often require you to provide personal information due to legislation for regular currencies. This is known as KYC, or \"Know Your Customer.\" This is harmless, since neither the exchange service nor the bank you send traditional currency from knows where the money goes - except that you are buying cryptocurrency. Learn more about KYC below, or click through to the payment instructions.",
  "pmnt_kyc_title": "KYC - Know Your Customer",
  "pmnt_kyc_content": "KYC is an abbreviation for \"Know Your Customer\", and is required for financial institutions in a number of countries to handle traditional currency.",
  "pmnt_kyc_content_two": "The KYC process is simple and harmless, and requires you to provide personal information, and in some cases a picture of physical identification and answer where the money you exchange comes from to the exchange service you use to buy cryptocurrency. In some cases you may also be asked to provide information about what you will use the cryptocurrency for, which they do to prevent money from going to fraudsters or for illegal purposes.",
  "pmnt_kyc_content_three": "You can answer whatever you want on these questions, since you cannot see who owns the addresses you send to anyway, and thus you cannot see what the money is used for. This is one of the great advantages of cryptocurrency.",
  "pmnt_kyc_content_four": "Now you know enough about cryptocurrency and KYC to proceed to the payment instructions. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions. Click the button below to get started.",
  "pmnt_guide_title": "Payment instructions",
  "pmnt_guide_content": "First and foremost, if you are familiar with cryptocurrency and have a wallet, and are aware of what kind of fees your wallet provider charges, you can use the payment information above to pay.",
  "pmnt_guide_content_two": "If you have never used cryptocurrency, the steps are relatively simple to relate to. The first thing to do is to open a crypto wallet or \"account\" with one of the recommended providers you find below. After this is done, you deposit cryptocurrency into your own wallet, before you in the last step transfer cryptocurrency by using the invoice details above to us.",
  "pmnt_guide_content_three": "Some providers give you the opportunity to skip account creation. It will see that they take the amount you are going to use, and the address you are going to send to, before you receive an account after the first transaction is completed.",
  "pmnt_guide_content_four": "All payment providers charge different fees for purchase and transfer. The amounts are everything from 4% to 15% markup on the amount you are going to pay in. This is reflected in our recommendations - the cheapest and safest will always be at the top.",
  "pmnt_guide_content_five": "To get started, click on one of the recommended providers in the list below for step-by-step guidance. The list is sorted by which provider we recommend at any time. First choose which country you live in, so that we can recommend providers that are specifically available in the country you live in.",
